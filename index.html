      This is a proposal for a Smart Village project based in Gavsi-Manapur Village, Nagpur District. On a site of 50 acres, the design includes a whole range of public and private rural amenities. Proper provision for vital public facilities for education, safety, and healthcare, finance, transport, etc. is made, like the bus stop, police chowky, bank branch, shops, doctors clinics, veterinary clinics and so on. Along with 75 housing units, other internal amenities include temple complex, garden, village panchayat ground, and common cattle sheds of 2 acres. The smart village design strives to achieve  social and environmental well-being. One of the objectives is to create opportunities for education and employment generation through conscious design decisions. Various efforts are made to build what could be called a ‘self-realised village’. The design promotes not only self-sufficient but also sustainable methods wherever possible. As regards the environmental aspect, numerous measures are taken, such as electricity generation at source by means of solar power and heat generation from biogas plants to serve the village. The design demonstrates attention to details by decisions like―orientation of the houses on an East-West axis for optimum use of natural daylight; the major streets being laid North-South to avoid direct sunlight for vehicular traffic; use of low-cost materials, etc. The use of wetlands for wastewater treatment, water supply from an elevated surface reservoir (ESR), and provision of a septic tank for sewage disposal are some of the essential elements of sustainable urban design that are also thoughtfully incorporated.
